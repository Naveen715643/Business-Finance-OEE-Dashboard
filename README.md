# 💼 Finance & OEE Analytics Dashboard | Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an **Enterprise Finance and Operational Performance Analytics Dashboard** developed using **Power BI**.

The solution combines **financial analytics, operational KPIs, and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** into a single unified dashboard to help stakeholders monitor business performance, production efficiency, and cost impact in real time.


## 🎯 Business Objective

Organizations often manage financial reporting and operational monitoring separately, making it difficult to connect performance with business outcomes.

This dashboard was built to:

* Centralize finance and operational analytics
* Track productivity and efficiency metrics
* Monitor OEE (Availability, Performance, Quality)
* Improve visibility into cost and production performance
* Support data-driven decision making


## 🧠 Business Use Case

Designed for manufacturing and operational environments where both **financial performance** and **production efficiency** are critical.

Target users:

✔ Finance Teams
✔ Plant Managers
✔ Operations Leaders
✔ Continuous Improvement Teams
